          At the March 2016 Geneva Motor Show, Apollo unveiled the Arrow, a hypercar that produces 1,000 hp from its twin-turbocharged 4.0 liter V8 engine. The Arrow can travel from 0-62 mph (100 km/h) in less than 2.9 seconds, and has a top speed of 220 mph (360 km/h).</p>

          Evantra Millecavalli is the extreme version of the Supercar Evantra presented in 2013 at Top Marques Monaco. Luca Mazzanti aimed at putting together all the important steps and improvements made until now, thanks to his skills and those of his team, developed during years of work. Evantra Millecavalli is equipped with a new 7.2 L V8 bi-turbo engine, capable of 1000 hp and of a torque higher than 1200 Nm directly to the rear wheels; this layout, combined with a specifically developed six-speed sequential gearbox, allows the Hypercar to destroy the 0-60 mph in only 2.7 seconds, reaching the speed of 250 mph, also thanks to the kerb weight of just 1300 kg.</p>

          The things that matter – It’s tear-drop cabin over a wing plane surface. Fixed rear wing and moving front wing for when it’s needed – big speed. With the tight cabin, you could argue the AF10 has more spaceship DNA than car. Consists of 5 parts, 4 motors and 1 petrol engine. In total the warp drive system weighs 280kg.

Each warp drive unit has it’s own gearbox, 2 speed for the electric drives and 6 speed for the petrol engine. Manual or Paddle-shift.</p>

          It’s an extraordinary-looking thing, with a tiny passenger compartment and a motorsport-style “keel” running beneath the car, and the 001’s aerodynamic mission is demonstrated by the fact that the face it presents to the wind is as much gap as it is bodywork. According to Marek Reichman, Aston Martin’s chief creative officer, approximately 100 copies will be built—the final figure is still being decided—with two variants, one being fully street legal and one being track only. </p>

           The LaFerrari needs few superlatives. It is our most ambitious project yet, pushing the boundaries of technology for a road car. It gathers together the marque's greatest technical capabilities from both GT and Formula 1 engineering, delivering the highest performance ever reached by a production Ferrari. And yet, the cause is noble. All this advanced technology will filter to the rest of the Ferrari model range.</p>

  The cabin has also been entirely redesigned, making extensive use of leather, Alcantara, carbon fiber, and aluminum. For customers who want to make their TS1 unique, Zenvo promises the new interior is entirely customizable. </p>
